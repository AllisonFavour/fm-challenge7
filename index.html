                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned
                were current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I
                honestly feel i got every pennys worth.

                "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp i've
                been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
                time of my life. Since completing the course, i've successfully
                switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                startup."

                as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.

                "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
                I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
                entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
                team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
                learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
                have. In fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an
                example of my development experience. It certainly helped me
                land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple
                offers. 100% recommended!"
